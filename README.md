data source: Data set found online for NBA player data from 1948 to 2018 (uploaded onto github)

what you want to convey in the table: Height change over time of the whole NBA and the three grouped positions in the NBA(Centers, Forwards, and Guards)

what functionality you put into the table and why: I put the graph columns in the table because I thought this would be the best way to show
the percent change best as they are fairly small percent changes but also can be compared with eachother.

what formatting you put into the table and why: Formatting is the basic table formatting. I think the default year sorting is best to show the idea of how the
height of players changed over time, and reactable also has nice sorting features built in.
